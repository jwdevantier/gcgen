gcgen Documentation
===================================
gcgen aims to provide a minimal, yet useful tool to aid with code generation, 
predominantly by allowing you to weave snippets of generated code in among
otherwise hand-written code, though generating entire files from scratch
is also supported.

gcgen is written for ease of use, thus it:

* Enables active code-generation
* Allows generated code to be mixed in among hand-written code
* Separates generator code from the project's source files
* Introduces very few concepts to learn
* Provides the full expressive power and library ecosystem of the Python programming language
